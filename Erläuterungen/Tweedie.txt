üîç Why we use Tweedie for premium/risk modeling

In insurance pricing (esp. for property, motor, liability, etc.), the Tweedie family is widely used because it captures both claim frequency and severity in a single model.

üí° The context

Your response variable is pure premium =

pure premium = total incurred / exposure

This can be zero (no claim) or positive (some loss).

Hence, the underlying data distribution:

mass at 0 (no claim)

continuous positive part (claim amount > 0)

That combination cannot be modeled by Normal, Poisson, or Gamma alone ‚Äî but Tweedie handles it elegantly.

‚öñÔ∏è What Tweedie actually is

The Tweedie family is part of the exponential dispersion family (EDF) and bridges distributions:

| `var.power` | Equivalent distribution            | Typical use                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0           | Normal                             | continuous, symmetric          |
| 1           | Poisson                            | count data                     |
| (1,2)       | **Tweedie compound Poisson‚ÄìGamma** | insurance losses               |
| 2           | Gamma                              | positive continuous (severity) |
| 3           | Inverse Gaussian                   | heavy-tailed continuous        |

When 1 < var.power < 2, the distribution behaves like:

number of claims ~ Poisson
claim size ~ Gamma
total cost = sum of claim sizes

So, it implicitly models both frequency and severity.

üßÆ Why not use others?

Let‚Äôs compare:
| Family                                | When it‚Äôs used                                     | Why not ideal here                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gaussian (Normal)**                 | continuous symmetric data (residuals, not costs)   | can predict negative values; ignores zero mass                      |
| **Poisson**                           | pure count models (claim frequency)                | can‚Äôt model severity; pure premium isn‚Äôt integer                    |
| **Gamma**                             | positive continuous (claim severity or cost ratio) | assumes no zeros; needs conditional modeling (two-step)             |
| **Log-normal**                        | severity modeling (loss given claim)               | not a GLM family; difficult for regression-based exposure weighting |
| **Quasi-Poisson / Negative Binomial** | overdispersed counts                               | again: only for counts, not for cost per exposure                   |

So:

Poisson + Gamma (two models) = classical frequency‚Äìseverity decomposition.

Tweedie (single model) = frequency √ó severity combined (compound distribution).

üí° Practical interpretation in your case

mdl <- glm(fml, data=df,
           family = tweedie(var.power=1.5, link.power=0),  # log-Link
           weights = exp)

means:

var.power = 1.5 ‚Üí assume claims follow a compound Poisson-Gamma (typical for property lines).

link.power = 0 ‚Üí log link, so coefficients act multiplicatively on the mean cost.

weights = exp (or offset log(exp)) ‚Üí accounts for exposure time (earned exposure).

This setup gives:...

freq_mdl <- glm(claim_count ~ factors, family = poisson, offset = log(exp))
sev_mdl  <- glm(avg_claim   ~ factors, family = Gamma(link="log"))


and combine them to get:

pure_premium = predict(freq_mdl, type="response") * predict(sev_mdl, type="response")


That approach offers more flexibility but is two-stage and often less stable on small data.

| Model                      | Strength                                      | Use case                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Tweedie GLM**            | Unified freq+sev, log link, exposure-weighted | Best for portfolio-level pure premium modeling |
| **Poisson+Gamma (2-step)** | Flexible separation of components             | When you have detailed claim counts/severity   |
| **Gamma only**             | Conditional severity modeling                 | When modeling loss given claim                 |
| **Gaussian / others**      | Analytical/diagnostic use                     | Not appropriate for loss cost data             |
